# Jeevan Kosh 🧬

### An Integrated Digital Health Ecosystem for Maternal & Child Health (MCH)

Jeevan Kosh is a unified, patient-controlled digital health platform designed to eliminate fragmented medical records in Maternal & Child Health (MCH). It creates a **single, lifelong health record** starting from pregnancy and seamlessly connects **ASHA workers, patients, doctors, AI, and IoT devices** into one continuous chain of care.

Developed as a health-tech solution focusing on rural and semi-urban India, Jeevan Kosh addresses both **first-mile (field)** and **last-mile (clinical)** healthcare gaps.

## 📌 Problem Statement

### 1. Last-Mile Clinical Problems

- Fragmented medical records across hospitals and clinics
- Loss of paper-based prescriptions and vaccination cards
- Doctors forced to diagnose without complete patient history
- Redundant tests and medication conflicts

### 2. First-Mile Field Problems

- ASHA workers overburdened with manual paperwork
- Field data never reaches doctors
- Delayed detection of high-risk pregnancies
- Preventable maternal and infant mortality

## 💡 Solution Overview

Jeevan Kosh integrates **three core components** into a single digital ecosystem:

### 1️⃣ ASHA Worker Toolkit (Mobile Antenatal Assistant)

- Android-based offline-first mobile app
- BLE-enabled IoT devices (BP, SpO₂, Temperature)
- On-device AI for **offline risk classification**
- Vernacular UI with voice/chatbot support (Swasthya Sakhi)

### 2️⃣ Patient-Controlled Electronic Health Record (EHR)

- Creation of a **Genesis Record** at first antenatal registration
- Secure lifelong health wallet
- Stores vitals, diagnoses, prescriptions, and vaccination history
- AI-powered reminders for checkups and immunizations

### 3️⃣ Doctor Secure-Share Portal

- Temporary OTP-based access to patient records
- Read-only access with full chronological history
- Mandatory digital diagnosis and prescription entry
- Updates are digitally signed and appended to the ledger

## 🔁 How Jeevan Kosh Works

1. ASHA registers pregnancy → **Genesis Record created**
2. IoT devices capture vitals during home visits
3. On-device AI classifies risk (Normal / Moderate / High)
4. Data syncs securely when internet is available
5. Patient shares OTP with doctor during consultation
6. Doctor reviews complete history and updates diagnosis
7. Continuous reminders and alerts generated by AI
